    <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Both SMAD and CIS teams will need to combine their skills and goals to deliver a product that fits the client and users’ needs. The scope of work for SMAD will include: User Research, Personas, User Stories, Branding, Wireframes, Low-Mid Fidelity Mockups and the final Bootstrap 5 compatible site. The team will deliver these through sprints, which will take place every two weeks until the final deliverable.</p>

    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
	   <p>Looking at this project from the UX perspective, we need to focus on how we can enhance user satisfaction with the end product while also maintaining the client’s vision. Our main goal is to design a product that helps users clearly and concisely understand whatever material that they are working with in a way that is easy to digest. We also need to create a brand identity for the product that effectively communicates its style and image to its users.</p>

    <h2>Audience / Personas</h2>

    <h2>Obstacles</h2>
        <p>The dashboards contain information in relation to their topic. As a result, there is no consistency between some dashboards, i.e. word cloud titles and interaction layouts for narratives and political reports. In addition, some dashboards have different design visualizations of certain data. Do we have to account for the design layout depending on the topic?</p>
