    <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Both SMAD and CIS teams will need to combine their skills and goals to deliver a product that fits the client and users’ needs. The scope of work for SMAD will include: User Research, Personas, User Stories, Branding, Wireframes, Low-Mid Fidelity Mockups and the final Bootstrap 5 compatible site. The team will deliver these through sprints, which will take place every two weeks until the final deliverable.</p>

    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
	   <p>Looking at this project from the UX perspective, we need to focus on how we can enhance user satisfaction with the end product while also maintaining the client’s vision. Our main goal is to design a product that helps users clearly and concisely understand whatever material that they are working with in a way that is easy to digest. We also need to create a brand identity for the product that effectively communicates its style and image to its users.</p>

    <h2>Audience / Personas</h2>
        <p>Legal Community / Government Officials: 
    Federal attorney spends most of his time drafting regulations, reading and updating legal reviews, and assisting in policy issues.  Most of his time is spent reading detailed court case briefs, legal documents, and other lengthy documentation that he then reports on.  He would like a way to search a document and identify where certain people or topics are mentioned and identify the main topics of the report.  By having this information, he would be able to sort through important documents faster and find the exact information needed for a specific case. </p>
 
    <h2>Journalists</h2>
        <p>Journalist was recently hired as a journalist for The Wall Street Journal in New York. She writes for the Business and Tech articles and is often spending hours researching and gathering information from documents and reports online.  Journalist would prefer to spend less time reading through documents for key information and would rather dedicate more time to interviewing and writing her articles.  The key information she looks for is who is involved and where, what occurred / what will happen, and why it is important to her readers.  If she could find a way to quickly receive this information, she believes her output would improve and she would be up for a promotion in a few months.  </p>  

    <h2>Researchers</h2>
        <p>Professor working at a college splits her time between teaching and researching human behavior.  In her research lab, she and her two colleges collect hours of recorded data along with hundreds of pages of notes and observations.  While also teaching, the Professor does not have as much time as she would like to sort through the data to find patterns between the patients.  If she could see how many times some words were mentioned and break down the data without having to manually count everything, she would be able to publish her research earlier.  </p>

    <h2>Obstacles</h2>
        <p>The dashboards contain information in relation to their topic. As a result, there is no consistency between some dashboards, i.e. word cloud titles and interaction layouts for narratives and political reports. In addition, some dashboards have different design visualizations of certain data. Do we have to account for the design layout depending on the topic?</p>
