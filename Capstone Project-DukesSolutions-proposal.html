    <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>SMAD and CIS teams will need work together to deliver a product that fits the client and users’ needs. The scope of work for SMAD will include: User Research, Personas, User Stories, Branding, Wireframes, Low-Mid Fidelity Mockups and the final Bootstrap 5 compatible site. The scope of work for CIS will include: developing a system using MS SQL Server and .Net, having the final system hosted on Amazon instance, providing time and cost estimates and implementing other technical functionalities. The team will deliver these through sprints, which will take place roughly every two weeks until the final deliverable.</p>

    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Develop a functioning system (no errors, blow ups) to the best of our abilities within the time frame</li>
            <li>Enhance user satisfaction with the end product while also maintaining the client’s vision</li>
            <li>Design a product that helps users clearly and concisely understand whatever material that they are working with in a way that is easy to digest</li>
            <li>Create a brand identity for the product that effectively communicates its style and image to its users</li>
        </ul>

         <h2>Project Management</h2>
        <p>Each member of the team has each other's phone numbers and emails. Communication between the team and the professors will be done by the Project Manager and communication with the client will be done by the client liaison. Methods used to communicate will include: emails and in person visits. Dukes Solutions communicates as a team through GroupMe and Zoom.</p>
    
    <h2>Obstacles & Potential Technical Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>CIS: We have to understand the client’s requirements and make sure that the project is feasible, can be done on time, and under budget. There are underlying obstacles such as scope creep as well. All of these obstacles will be mitigated with a structured and organized plan. We could run into technical issues because it is the first time using Visual Studios and MS SQL for most of the CIS members but researching and studying can mitigate that.</li>
            <li>SMAD: The dashboards contain information in relation to their topic. As a result, there is no consistency between some dashboards, i.e. word cloud titles and interaction layouts for narratives and political reports. In addition, some dashboards have different design visualizations of certain data. Do we have to account for the design layout depending on the topic?</li>
